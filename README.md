## Test Assessment

Welcome to the VCS test assessment. You'll be writing code to make RSpec tests pass.

**Important!** Upon running `rspec` or `bundle exec rspec` you'll get the following error:**

```bash
LoadError: cannot load such file -- hello
```

This is expected and you are to resolve this like in the `learn_ruby` assignment.

**Otherwise**, if at anytime you have other technical difficulties tell an instructor and we'll help you resolve them.



### Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repo
1. `cd` into the project directory, add your name to the top of this README file
1. Commit and push and verify it works properly
1. Run `bundle install`
1. Run `bundle exec rspec`
1. If all is working properly you should see an error something like:

```bash
LoadError: cannot load such file -- hello
```

You're ready to build!


### Testing

Your mission is to make the tests in the `spec/` folder pass. 

1. Start with the error above, resolve it
1. Once you can, run the tests
1. Look at the expectation(s) for each test
1. Write the code necessary to make the tests pass in the `lib/` directory


### Grading

Your grade will be the percentage of: `PASSING_TESTS / TOTAL_TESTS`



**Good luck!**
